                offer free education to all programs in college. 
                The school is supported with different government sectors and NGOs. South East Asian Institute of Technology, Inc. with its famous acronym SEAIT was formed like a drama with a glaring spotlights in an amphitheater. The backdrops were up, the playwrights were ready, the actors and actresses well-dressed, the orchestra were playing the timeless music and the curtain started to open………slowly.
                February 2006 marked the foundation of the dream school, not with the breaking ground but with the first cracking of the door in literal sense,
                the school occupied a rented space at Shell Gasoline station near Valera’s place still in Tupi which catered minimal population of students who too up vocational courses.
                he Tamayos reminisced their struggles upon putting the desired institution. One of these struggles was the conduciveness of learning employed in the pilot institution. <a href="http://seait-edu.ph/about.php">Learn More</a>
